For example, red would be (255,0,0), green (0,255,0), white (255,255,255), and black (0,0,0).\n",

While that would work to some extend, you might find that the resulting image doesn't really match your own perception of the original colour image. This is because humans do not perceive red, green, and blue in the same ways.\n",

You can use the class `car` to build a car object.\n",
