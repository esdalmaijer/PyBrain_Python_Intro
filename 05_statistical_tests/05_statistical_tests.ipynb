To compute it, you simply take the difference between each measurement and the mean. Unfortunately, when you average those differences, you should end up at 0, because there will be as many positive as there are negative differences (assuming the data is normally distributed). To deal with this, you could simply square all differences between each measurement and the mean. In that way, all differences are positive, so you can safely average them.

Take, for example, a breath-holding time of 67 seconds (20 seconds above the average): If measurements on average deviated 100 seconds from the average, then 20 seconds doesn't sound like a very big value.

    "To illustrate the concept of correlation, let's turn to a dataset. We asked a bunch of Cambridge students<sup>\\*</sup> how often they listen to Taylor Swift (minutes per day), and how happy they would rate themselves on a scale of 0-10. We also recorded what year they were in. We then divided the dataset into 6 groups: undergrad years 1-4, MPhil or equivalent, and PhD. We then sorted the data to match individuals across the 6 groups who reported the exact same listening time. Miraculously, the groups matched *perfectly*. The data are stored in the attached `happy_taytay.csv` file. In this file, each row represents individual participants with the exact same daily Swift listening time. Each column represents a variable: the first is daily Swift listening time, the second is the happiness rating of 1st Year undergrads, the third is the happiness rating of 2nd Year students, etc. until we reach the happiness rating of PhD students in the final column.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you want to compute a correlation, but your data are *not* normally distributed, the closest alternative might just be Spearman's $\\rho$ (Greek letter \"rho\"). Not unlike [the honey badger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg), Spearman doesn't care about how your data is distributed. Instead, it simply rank-orders all the values in both variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spearman's $\\rho$ thus depends on the covariance of the ranked variables x and y, not on their actual values. The equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho = {{cov(rg_{x}, rg_{y})} \\over {\\sigma_{rg_{x}} \\sigma_{rg_{y}}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $rg_{x}$ is simply the rank-score of each value in the variable x. For example, if $x = [2, 5, 3]$ then $rg_{x} = [1, 3, 2]$. $\\sigma_{rg_{x}}$ is the standard deviation of the rank-scored values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: the covariance in this equation is treated subtly differently from the covariance in the equation for Pearson's correlation coefficient. Specifically, the value is computed in exactly the same way, but for Spearman's $\\rho$ it is divided by the number of observations. A similar thing is true for the standard deviation, which is used here instead of the variance used for the Pearson's R computation above.\n",
